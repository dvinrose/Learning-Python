Implement function average() that takes two numbers as input and returns the average of
the numbers. You should write your implementation in a module you will name average.py.
A sample usage is:
average(1,3)
2.0
average(2, 3.5)
2.75

def average( a, b):
    return (a+b) / 2

print(average( 2, 3.5))
