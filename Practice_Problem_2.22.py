2.22 The range of a list of numbers is the largest difference between any two numbers in the
list. Write a Python expression that computes the range of a list of numbers lst. If the list
lst is, say, [3, 7, -2, 12], the expression should evaluate to 14 (the difference between
12 and âˆ’2).

for i in range(min(lisR),max(lisR)):
    v = v + 1
